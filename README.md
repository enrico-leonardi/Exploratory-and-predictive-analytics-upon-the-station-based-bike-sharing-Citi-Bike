## Description:
The topic of this year's challenge has been **mobility**. At a time when the world is facing unprecedented challenges of different kinds, including climate change, pandemics, social inequality, and degrading biodiversity, sharing mobility services offer and emission-free mobility option that is both efficient and attractive. In this project, we have been asked to use our best Data Sciences skills to help operators to manage their fleet, providing better a service and enhancing their business model.

## Data
We worked with a dataset obtained through **Citi Bike (New York)**, one of the biggest station-based bike sharing systems in the US. The dataset includes more than 900 stations and 14000 bikes, and it contains over **17 million bike rides** observed **during 2018**. The data is publicly available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata, additional information about the dataset can be found at https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data.

## Goal
The challenge dealt with clustering the stations spatially and building a prediction model that, at the end of a day, allowed to predict what the demand for a cluster of stations will be over the next 24 hours.

## Usage
The data analysis result will be presented by running the Jupyter Notebook titled "Enrico_Clara_Yunxuan.ipynb".
